Hi Tom,

We would love to get going on this, but I cannot issue a certificate unless the request comes from the client directly or if it is a renewal of a certificate that was previously approved by the client. I do not see you in their current approved list. Please contact the insured directly to submit your request.

Subject: Certificate of Insurance Request - Dale E. Feeb dba ActionMaster Restoration by 24-7 Services

Hi TOri,

I hope your week is going well. My name is Tom and I'm working with Dale and AT of Dale E. Feeb dba ActionMaster Restoration by 24-7 Servicesto help them obtain some SBA financing. As a part of this process, the bank we are working with requires verification of insurance on acord 25 and 27 forms. I have outlined the way this needs to be formatted below:

1. Certificate of Liability Insurance (For commercial general liability) - The bank needs to be listed as Certificate Holder. This can be written as ""Key Star Bank is listed as Certificate Holder"" on the Description of Operations Box.

Each occurrence must be for at least $1,000,000
2. Evidence of Property Insurance (For Business Personal Property Insurance) - The bank must be listed as Lenders Loss Payable. This can be done by checking the box and typing in ""LENDERS LOSS PAYABLE"" under the additional insured box in the Additional Interest section at the bottom of the form.
*If listed as Lenders Loss Payee, this will be incorrect and not acceptable*

The deductible can not exceed $1,000

3. Proof of Workers Compensation Insurance - Need a statement that includes a policy number and name of the business.

4. Proof of Vehicle Insurance - Key Star Bank must be listed as Loss Payee and the business must have comprehensive and collision insurance for each vehicle. Please be sure to list the VIN for each one along wth the replacement cost.

Bank Information:
Key star Bank
ATTN: Loan Dept.
1234 Key Star Blvd, Ste 103
Stoplin, CA 95677

Let me know if you have any questions for me or need anything else. I appreciate your help and time with this.

Best,
