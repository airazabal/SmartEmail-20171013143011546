Hi Dominic
We just spoke to above insured.  It looks like the building they are located in is actually a Condo.  The owner owns both the condo and the business but in different LLC.  Condo is owned by My Sons, LLC and the business is DataCloud, LLC.  (same owner).  Not sure if we need to make changes to the coverages.  We currently have BPP $89,500 and Tenant B&I $10,000.  Looks like we might need to add
Condo Unit Owner - Personal Property?

Would this replace both BPP and Tenant B&I?  We will also need to add My Sons, LLC as Additional Insured. Can you let me know how to proceed.
Thank you
